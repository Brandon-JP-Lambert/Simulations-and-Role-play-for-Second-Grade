# Simulations-and-Role-play-for-Second-Grade

Welcome to the "2nd Grade Role-Play Resource Generator" repository! This tool aims to assist second-grade teachers in using AI models like ChatGPT to create useful resources for simulations and role-play exercises. These activities can help students develop effective communication skills and better manage interpersonal relationships.

## Features

This repository includes:

1. **Role-Play Scenario Generator**: Structured prompts that generate conversations between a student and a stuffed sloth. These scenarios aim to promote positive communication habits among second graders.

2. **Key Phrase List**: A prompt designed to list important phrases used in the conversations, along with their meanings. This aids in enhancing students' understanding and use of positive communication.

3. **Gap-Fill Exercise Creator**: Prompts that convert the generated conversations into gap-fill exercises, offering an interactive way to reinforce the learnt communication skills.

## Prompts
```
1. When my students are having a hard time communicating kindly with others I have them come into the classroom and talk to a stuffed sloth to practice better communication. My students are second graders. Please write three sample conversations between a second grader and the sloth to help the learner develop these skills.
2. Write a list of the key phrases a student would need in this conversation and what they mean.
3. Please transform the conversations into gap fill exercises with blanks.
